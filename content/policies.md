 - written (20%)                     |
 - presentation (10%)                |


### Participation and homework

Students are expected to attend class prepared and participate actively. Satisfactory 
preparation implies having read the assigned reading and completing necessary homework 
beforehand. Satisfactory participation implies asking questions, taking part in class 
discussion, and showing general understanding of the relevant material. The assigned 
readings are difficult and will require time and effort. 

### Presentations

There will be 8 student led class presentations, 2 for each area. Students are required 
to present one time each with a partner. Presentation order and assignments will be 
established during the first weeks of class. The student responsible for leading discussion 
should prepare slides, handouts, and questions/ideas to foment participation amongst peers. 
Groups are encouraged to use slack before and after the presentation for discussion and to 
share resources. The presentation materials must be shared with the professor the night before 
the actual presentation. 

### Area essays

At the end of each module there will be a writing assignment in the form of a short essay. 
Each student must complete two of the four essays. There will be specific instructions given 
the week before the essay is due. 

### Final project

Each student will complete a research project related to one of the four areas. 
All projects require the prior approval of the professor. Projects are due on 
the day and time of the university assigned final exam (though there is no exam). 
Students will present their work in a semi-finished state during the final two 
weeks of the semester (10 min. presentation + 5 min. for questions). Students are 
encouraged to begin thinking about their topic from the beginning of the semester, 
and work with the professor to ensure that it is appropriate. Possible ideas:

- Pedagogy
    - Teaching portfolios
    - Classroom observations and analyses
    - Technology in the classroom
- Use
    - Sociolinguistic interview
    - Spanish in U.S., New Jersey
    - 3rd language acquisition
- Analysis/Processes
    - Participation in university approved research
    - Original research
    - Etc.





## Department rules and course policy

The course is designed to satisfy the learning goals of the Department of Spanish 
and Portuguese. More information available at: http://span-port.rutgers.edu/learning-goals

### Communication 

All course communication will be via Slack. You should have received an email 
with an invitation link to join the course Slack. Some rules for using Slack:

- Use an identifiable username and add your picture to your profile.
- Only the professor is allowed to use the **@channel** and **@here** mentions.
- While this is an informal communication channel, all rules of academic discourse apply.
- Ask and answer questions on the appropriate channel.
- Create channels as needed, especially for group presentations.

### Attendance

Regular class attendance is essential for successful completion of the course. 
More than 4 absences will have a negative effect on your final grade. Arriving 
to class ten minutes late is considered an absence. The 4th absence and every 
subsequent absence after that will result in the loss of 5% point off the final 
overall course grade, regardless of reason. Keep in mind that while you have 3 
"free" absences, on the day/s you miss you will not be able to earn participation 
points, and you will miss the material given in class. If you are absent, contact 
a classmate immediately to get the assignments and to keep up with the material 
scheduled in the syllabus. The instructor is not responsible to put you up to 
date. Do not send emails to the instructor asking for updates if you missed 
class (i.e. "I was absent today. Did we do anything important?"). More 
information regarding the university policy on self-reporting absences is 
available here: https://sims.rutgers.edu/ssra/

Any planned absence that you are aware of ahead of time, such as religious 
holidays recognized by Rutgers University or Dean's excuses, should be 
made up before the absence occurs. If you know that you will be absent, it is 
your responsibility to let the instructor know ahead of time. All holidays or 
special events observed by any religion will be honored for those students who 
show affiliation with that particular religion. Absences pre-approved by the RU 
Dean of Students (or Dean's designee) will be honored. More information available 
here: https://scheduling.rutgers.edu/scheduling/religious-holiday-policy

### Code of academic integrity

The professor will initiate an academic integrity case against students 
suspected of cheating, plagiarizing, or aiding others in dishonest academic 
behavior. Students are responsible for reading and understanding the Code of 
Academic Integrity.

Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, plagiarism, 
cheating, and aiding and abetting dishonesty. An example of plagiarism would be 
to submit a written sample which in part or in whole is not the student's own 
work without attributing the source. Cheating includes allowing another person 
to do your work and to submit the work under one's own name. Any work which is 
submitted for a grade must be 100% the student's own work. If you are not sure 
when it is appropriate to seek help, please see the professor.


----

**Plagiarism** is the use of another person’s words, ideas, or 
results without giving that person appropriate credit. Do not plagiarize.

### Students with disabilities

Rutgers University welcomes students with disabilities into all of the 
University's educational programs. In order to receive consideration for 
reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact the 
appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially 
enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: 
[https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines](https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines).  

If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your 
campus’s disability services office will provide you with a Letter of 
Accommodations. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the 
accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. To begin this 
process, please complete the Registration form on the ODS web site at: 
[https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/registration-form](https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/registration-form).
